0	n/a			n/a				The program succesfully ran and quit without errors.

301	bus.cpp			programmer error		Address mapping conflict: two devices want to occupy overlapping address ranges on bus.
310	bus.cpp			programmer error		A Bus::Device object was instantiated with an invalid address range, because min address exceeds max address.
311*	bus.cpp			program(mer) error		A class derived from Bus::Device did not implement ReadFromDevice method, but another device tried to read from it. (* Debug build only)
312*	bus.cpp			program(mer) error		A class derived from Bus::Device did not implement WriteFromDevice method, but another device tried to write to it. (* Debug build only)

400*	memory.cpp		program(mer) error		Illegal write operation to ROM. ROM is read-only. (* Debug build only)

500	nes-cartridge.cpp	user error			NES-specific. Tried to load a file that is not a valid iNES ROM file.
510	nes-mapper.cpp		unsupported operation		NES-specific. No compatible mapper available for this cartridge.
550	nes-romfile.cpp		user/program error		NES-specific. Cannot access ROM file at path specified by user.
560	nes-romfile.cpp		unsupported operation		NES-specific. No support (yet) for this NES ROM file format.

620	nes-ppu.cpp		unsupported opertaion		NES-specific. User supplied a ROM that uses a nametable mirroring mode that PPU emulation does not (yet) support.
630     nes-ppu.cpp         	unsupported opertaion   	NES-specific. User supplied a ROM that uses a video system (PAL) that PPU emulation does not support.
666*	nes-ppu.cpp		programmer error		NES-specific. Array out of bounds error when writing to PPU screen buffer. (* Debug build only)

710	nes-apu.cpp		programmer error		NES-specific. APU's FillAudioBuffer method was called with a buffer size that exceeds APU's internal buffer size.

7300	qk-renderer		programmer error		The required SDL subsystems were not initialized before starting renderer.
7301	qk-renderer		system error			Failed to open a compatible audio device.
